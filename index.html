Tired of not knowing the times tables? 

  </H1>
  <p>
    
      This web project is designed to help people who for any of a number of reasons haven't gotten the times tables learned (some or all of them), and are willing to try some lessons and practice. 
</p><p>
      I've also been working on videos for folks who want to be able to add and subtract mentally, but kept hearing from people looking for resources to *learn* the times tables, as opposed to practice them.   
    </p><p>
      Finally, I think   the Open Educational Resource community is starting to embrace the idea that we *can* create good interactive experiences with CSS and HTML5 and JavaScript.... but... I'm trying to figure out where and how :)   I've put a <a href="https://www1.rebus.community/#/project/caf3fab4-19f3-4fdd-a92f-cbc0b1871c8a">project up with the Rebus Community;</a> in past years I've participated in adult ed OER projects and I'm looking for more.  
    </p>
    <p>   Here's the intro video:   yes, they are all short! The transcripts and screenshots are underneath...links will be along the side to the powerpoints I made the videos from. </p>

<p>  Mastering Multiplication:   These are the times! Let's get to the facts!</p>

<p> I’d like to introduce you to multiplication.   </p>

<p>Multiplication is where, for lots of people, math became something to memorize.
Well, memorizing is a good thing, and that’s a big part of this little course.</p>

<p>

We’re going to approach it, though, from understanding numbers and how they work.   It’s like riding a bike or driving a car – it’s good to know how to use it, but it’s even better to understand how it works. </p>

<p>Why should you bother?   </p>

<p> 
It’s an investment – work harder now, work easier later. 
especially because understanding makes the brain remember things better. 
You just might surprise yourself.

<p>Here are the times tables lined up in a chart.   To find 5 x 5 we find where the 5 column and 5 column cross -- 
  </p>

<p>
  BUT!  We want to get to where you don’t even need to use a chart.   5 x 5 will always be 25... We’ll use this to keep track of the ones you’re learning.   
</p><p>
There are 121 facts on the chart – next lesson – knocking off the first 21 
